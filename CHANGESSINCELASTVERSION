Changes since v0.33

First Alpha:
* Added /rssell - a new method for players to sell stuff to stores. Will replace 
the old one by 0.40, I'm not sure it's ready to use now but it seems to work. 
Simply type /rssell and a window pops up. Place the items you want to sell there 
and close the window.
* Added some notifications. When a player buys or sells to your store you are 
notified within 10 sec, or when you log in. To be extended and improved.
* Begun working on internal economy and an AI-system which (if you want it to) 
can lower or higher your prices based on demand of items in your and others' stores.

Second Alpha:
* Removed the old way of selling items to the store. Replaced by /rssell
* Added support for item damage/data value in prices. You can set the price for all 
items with a certain id as usual, but you can also override that price like this: 
ID:DATA:COST


Note that this alpha version should not be used on larger servers.
(The config files are not changed by the way, they still say it's version 0.33)
