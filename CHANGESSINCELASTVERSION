Changes since v0.33

Commands:
* Added /rssell - a new method for players to sell stuff to stores, replacing the 
old one.
* Added a 'help' argument to /rsstores.
* Added 'notifications' argument to /rsstores.
* Added 'onchange' argument to /rsstores.
* Added 'clear' and 'copy' arguments to /rssetprices.

Misc:
* Added some notifications.
* Added internal economy which is used when Vault can't find an economy plugin 
(or when Vault isn't found).
* Added support for item data value in prices. You can set the price for all 
items with a certain id as usual, but you can also override that price like this: 
ID:DATA:COST

Added 6 lines in config:
* notificatior-update-frequency - in milliseconds how often the notifications thread 
should be ran. Anything bellow 500 disables notifications.
* enable-automatic-store-management - if the server allows stores to monitor statistics 
from itself and other stores, and also if the stores may automaticly change prices.
* statistics-timespan - how old statistics are "remembered". On servers where things 
happen fast, use a shorter timespan. On "slow" servers, a larger one.
* stat-updater-frequency - how often the statistics thread should be ran.
* clean-stats-older-than - how old statistics can be before they are removed from the database.
* allow-filling-chests - if users are allowed to use commands that fill chests. Set 
this to false if you have some kind of chest protection plugin. Also disables shopping 
carts and shipping.

Altered in config:
* enable-shopping-carts-in-worlds - you can use @all to enable carts in all worlds.
