Changes since v0.44

Besides a rewrite of a lot of stuff, RealShopping 0.50 comes with a few new, but important features. 
The smaller improvements which I originally had planned for 0.50 are postponed to 0.51, but here's 
what you get in this version:

* Added search option to /rsprices. Instead of browsing through several pages of prices you can now 
search for the item you need.
* Added aliases - Six hundred of them! That's more than enough for every item ID and data value 
combination. Instead of typing item IDs when executing commands you can write the name of the item, 
and the plugin will recongnize it. For a complete list and more detailed instructions, see the 
plugin page.
* Added interactive prompts for /rsset, /rssetstores and /rssetchests. This simplifies creating 
stores (especially ones with many entrances) and managing self-refilling chests. In case something 
goes wrong, all prompts can be aborted with quit.
* Added free manage mode to the /rssetchests prompt. Open a chest, put items in, and close it. The 
chest contents will be permanently updated.
* Added the multiplication sign to additems and delitems in /rssetchests. If you want to add the same 
item stack several times in a row to a chest, you can type it once and put a multiplication sign 
followed by a number behind. Examples are on the plugin page.
