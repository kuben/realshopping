Changes since v0.42

* Added /rsimport. Used for importing prices from an Excel sheet. Still a lot left to improve..
* Added /rssetprices defaults [STORE]. Related to the above point
* Updated Language Pack.
* Right-clicking an item frame with paper in (while in a store) displays the prices.
* You can now use doors as entrances in stores (although glass is safer).

New in config:
* enable-doors-as-entrances : If the mod should let you use a door instead of glass blocks/panes as an entrance/exit.
